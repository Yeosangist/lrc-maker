# lrc-maker
Offline .lrc maker from .txt files

Inspired by [Megalobiz lrc maker](https://www.megalobiz.com/lrc/maker).<br>
Best used in conjunction with [lrcget](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget).<br>
<sub>(i.e. if not all of the songs in your library end up having .lrc files, and only .txt files, you can make your own with this.)</sub><br>
<br>
<br>
Pick a folder.
It'll scan for all .txt files and songs that match the filename and give you a selection box.<br>
Pick one and it will load the song and lyrics into a table.<br>
When you're finished, press export .lrc.<br>
It'll open the folder it was chosen from, and you can save it as a title.lrc file.<br>
Got another song to format? Click "Select song" and the song box will pop up again.<br>
Finished in that folder? "Select Folder" and the folder picker will show up again.<br>

My first real heavy project, so I hope everything works cool and good :) I might be fiddling with it to the end of time but I'm unleashing it upon the world as it is anyway.<br>
